      question: "Do I need a visa to visit Lesotho?",
      answer: "Visa requirements depend on your nationality. Citizens of many countries, including the US, UK, EU, Canada, and most Commonwealth countries can enter Lesotho visa-free for up to 30 days. Always check with your nearest Lesotho embassy or consulate for the most current information."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the best time to visit Lesotho?",
      answer: "The best time to visit depends on what you want to experience. For hiking and outdoor activities, April to May and September to October offer mild temperatures and clear skies. Winter (June to August) brings snow to the highlands and skiing opportunities at Afriski. Summer (November to March) has lush green landscapes but can bring heavy rainfall."
    },
    {
      question: "Is Lesotho safe for tourists?",
      answer: "Lesotho is generally safe for tourists, especially in areas frequented by visitors. As with travel anywhere, exercise normal precautions, avoid isolated areas after dark, and keep valuables secure. In rural areas, locals are typically friendly and hospitable. It's advisable to travel with a guide when exploring remote regions."
    },
    {
      question: "What currency is used in Lesotho?",
      answer: "The Lesotho Loti (LSL) is the official currency, but South African Rand (ZAR) is also widely accepted throughout the country. The Loti is pegged to the Rand at a 1:1 ratio. ATMs are available in major towns, and credit cards are accepted at larger hotels and businesses, though cash is preferred in rural areas."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I get to Lesotho?",
      answer: "The main points of entry are Moshoeshoe I International Airport near Maseru (with flights connecting through Johannesburg), and several road border crossings from South Africa. The Maseru Bridge is the most used land crossing. The scenic Sani Pass requires a 4x4 vehicle. There are also commercial bus services from major South African cities to Maseru."
    },
    {
      question: "What should I pack for a trip to Lesotho?",
      answer: "Pack according to the season, but always include layers as mountain weather can change quickly. Essentials include: sturdy walking shoes, sunscreen (the high altitude means stronger UV rays), a hat, rain jacket, and warm clothing (even in summer, evenings can be cool). If visiting in winter, bring heavy cold weather gear, especially if heading to the highlands."
